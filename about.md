## About the STEM+ Program at Marlborough

{% include base.html %}
<img width="50%" itemprop="image" class="img-rounded" src="{{ base }}/assets/img/video_game_cabinet.jpg" alt="Marlborough STEM+ Program">

The STEM+ Program at Marlborough is an interdepartmental effort that seeks to
increase student enthusiasm for activities related to science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and to instill students with a love of
creation and problem solving.

The program embraces connections between STEM activities and other areas, for
example STEM + Arts.  We reach students through a variety of STEM themed clubs
and teams, as well as integration of content into classroom curricula.

### Darren Kessner, PhD   _(Computer Science)_

Dr. Darren Kessner teaches Math and Computer Science, and serves as STEM
Program Co-Head.  In addition to developing the Computer Science curriculum at
Marlborough, Darren works with faculty in the Math, Science, and Visual and
Performing Arts departments to include computational thinking and coding in
existing classes.  Darren also supervises students in their research and
interdisciplinary projects involving computer science and engineering.  

In addition to having taught at secondary and college levels, Darren has over
20 years of experience as a software developer in various fields, including
computer security, computer graphics, and computational biology.  He has
published several scientific papers and open source software projects, and
regularly runs computer workshops for teachers and research scientists.

Andrew Witman is a STEM+ Co-Head at Marlborough School.   His primary
responsibility is overseeing Marlborough’s award winning robotics program,
which includes four teams competing in the FIRST Technical Challenge. Andrew
also teaches 8th grade science and computer programming classes in the
Processing language. In all his classes Andrew loves incorporating creativity,
iterative design, and how computer science and fabrication technology can
empower students to make almost anything. 

### Lee Hamill, PhD _(Engineering)_

Dr. Lee Hamill is a science instructor at Marlborough School. In addition to
teaching physics and engineering courses, Lee serves as a mentor for
Marlborough’s four FTC robotics teams. She holds a PhD in Materials Science
from the University of Southern California and bachelor’s degrees in Physics
and Environmental Analysis & Policy from Boston University. Though Lee finds
the content of what she teaches important, she is much more excited about the
opportunities these courses provide for students to practice and develop their
critical thinking and creative problem solving skills.
