This is an interesting article about the progress for women in the fields of
biology, chemistry and math - all of these fields have had a huge increase in
the number of women majoring in them. However, there is still a huge gender gap
in physics, engineering and tech.  How can we change this? Research has shown
that if we expose children to these fields at an early age, both genders will
be equally likely to say they are interested.  Read the article for more on
this topic!
