Five Robotics Alumnae returned for a virtual visit with our teams to share their insight and experience in STEM majors and careers post-Marlborough. The alumnae covered a wide range of topics, including how their robotics experience at Marlborough prepared them for college, how they sought and obtained desirable internships, and some extremely cool projects they have worked on!

Featuring:
- __Marlyse Reeves ‘13:__ Graduate Student in Computer Science at MIT
- __Lena Garbutt ‘14:__ BS in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon
- __Emma Price ‘18:__ Computer Science Major at Northeastern
- __Emma Suh ‘19:__ Undergraduate Researcher at MIT Media Lab
- __Kyra Kraft ‘19:__ Computer Science and Product Design Major at Stanford

A huge thank you to these alumnae for returning and sharing their knowledge with our current students!
