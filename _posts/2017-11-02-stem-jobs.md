This article from the NY Times discusses job prospects in STEM fields,
illustrating the important fact that not all STEM fields have the same job
opportunities.  

While there has been a push across the country to increase funding for STEM
education in general, nearly all the opportunities will come from computer
science.  Here are some of the most important points from the article:

* There are not enough job openings in life sciences, engineering, physical
  sciences, and mathematical sciences to accommodate the number of university
  graduates. Computer science is the only exception among STEM fields.

* The top 10 skills in demand on LinkedIn last year were all computer skills.

* Computer science graduates had the highest median pay of all college majors.
