This year Marlborough has 5 teams participating in a national
program called Project Invent. The mission of the program is to
create fearless problem solvers that do social good through
invention, and it is a fantastic way for students to gain
experience in social justice, engineering and entrepreneurship.
The year begins with teams being paired with a __Community
Partner__ - someone they spend time getting to know and
empathizing with.  Through a series of interviews, students
identify a need and get to work designing a solution.

Project Invent requires that the designed solution be a __physical
technology__. This means that the solution can't just be an app
but it also can't just be a physical product. This forces students
to dive into the world of microelectronics, such as Arduinos or
Raspberry Pis.

The year culminates with a __Demo Day__ in which teams pitch their
final product. All 5 teams will travel to San Diego in April to
showcase their invention to a panel of industry professionals.
This gives students the opportunity to experience the
entrepreneurial side of invention and consider the aspects that
make their product innovative.

challenges our teams are working on and the designs they have come
up with so far. Here are some
