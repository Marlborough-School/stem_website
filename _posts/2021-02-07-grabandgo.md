STEM instructors Mr. Witman, Dr. Hamill, and Dr. Kessner gave presentations at
the 
[2021 STEM Think Tank and Conference](https://stem.harpethhall.org/think-tank-conference/think-tank-overview).
This year the conference moved online, and sessions focused on how STEM
teachers have adjusted to online/hybrid education.

The STEM Think Tank & Conference is the nationâ€™s first conference focused on
the education of girls and women in STEM. In this conference, teachers,
administrators, and university and industry STEM professionals come together
for specific classroom lessons, research-based professional development
sessions, and the opportunity to interact with a full range of STEM
professionals.
