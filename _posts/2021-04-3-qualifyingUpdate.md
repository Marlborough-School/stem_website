Over the last several weeks, the four Marlborough Robotics teams were busy preparing for their participation in remote qualifying tournaments and a chance to advance to the Regional Championship. In the robot game, teams operated their robots at Marlborough and submitted match scores remotely. On the final day of each tournament, the teams gathered on Zoom to present their work to judges in a series of virtual interviews. Judges also evaluated each team's "Engineering Portfolio" which articulated the journey of their season and design process. I am proud to report that all four teams represented themselves extremely well, impressing the judges and earning a number of accolades;

__Sunday 3/28:__ The Marlbots and Cosmos competed remotely and virtually against 21 teams from around the region. Though our robot game performance was middle of the pack, our students wowed the judges and earned the following awards;
- __Marlbots earned 1st Place Inspire Award__, given to the best overall team. In this case for outstanding robot design, innovation, engineering portfolio, and outreach to the community! This award advances the Marlbots to the Regional Championship on April 24th.
- __Cosmos earned 2nd Place Judges Award__, given at the discretion of the judges. In this case for being a strong, up and coming team with a number of rookie team members.
- __Lee Hamill earned another Compass Award__ for being an outstanding mentor, as nominated by the Marlbots.

__Saturday 4/3:__ Curiosity  and Asteria competed virtually in judged categories against 22 other teams from around the region. Our teams had an impressive showing and were recognized in the following ways;
- __Curiosity earned 1st Place in the Robot Game__ for having the top cumulative score from their submitted matches. That driver practice really paid off!
- __Curiosity earned 2nd Place "Inspire Award"__, given to the 2nd best overall team that is strong in both technical and non-technical award categories.
- __Curiosity earned 1st Place "Think Award"__ for an outstanding Engineering Portfolio that clearly articulated their team's journey and robot design.
- __Asteria earned 3rd Place "Think Award"__, also for an outstanding Engineering Portfolio that clearly articulated their team's journey and robot design.

On April 24th Marlbots and Curiosity will represent us (virtually) in the Regional Championship, which will feature the top 36 teams from our SoCal region.
