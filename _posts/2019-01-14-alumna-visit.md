On Monday, alumna Madeleine Gaw ’15, a mechanical engineering major at Brown
University, came to Marlborough and gave a presentation on what’s it’s like to
be a woman majoring in engineering. The presentation included many helpful tips
on how to survive college from the point of a college student, including how to
pick a college, what to look for in a college, what to write about in a college
essay, and how to build a support system after getting to college.

She also introduced students to a program called the Society of Women
Engineers, or SWE for short.  Gaw chairs the section of SWE at Brown, and she
also brought up the idea of creating a section of SWE Next, which is
essentially SWE for high schools, at Marlborough. All in all, it was a
successful talk, and we were incredibly glad to have her speak to us.
