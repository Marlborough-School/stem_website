This weekend the Marlbots (3526) competed in the [FTC Robotics West Super
Regional Championship](http://ftcwest.org). This tournament draws the top 72
teams from thirteen western states and represents about the top 6% of teams in
that region. The team represented themselves and the school extremely well,
with their robot performing successfully in all nine of their qualification
matches. They fought through a very tough division and challenging matchups to
a 2-7 record in qualifying rounds. Despite this,The Marlbots can be proud of
the following accomplishments: The Marlbots earned the highest Ranking Points
of any team at the competition (this is a metric that indicates point scoring
ability and difficulty of schedule) Their robot had the second highest average
score for the "endgame" period of the competition in their division.  They had
the 17th highest Offensive Power Ranking out of the 72 teams (this is a metric
that indicates point scoring ability)
