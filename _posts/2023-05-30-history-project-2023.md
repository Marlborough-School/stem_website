Students in Dr. Dan Lynch's History class created web-based visual
novels for their final projects. Each student converted their
research and writing about the experiences of a person involved in
World War I or World War II into a compelling visual narrative
presentation.

Thank you to students Emma '25 and Riley '25 from Honors Computer
Science Projects (taught by Dr. Darren Kessner) for their support of
Dr. Lynch's students.
