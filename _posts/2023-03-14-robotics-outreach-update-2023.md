The Robotics Program's outreach efforts are in full swing with a number of
recent events. The goal of robotics outreach is twofold; inspire others'
interest in STEM and have our students learn from professionals in STEM fields.
Here are some recent highlights not mentioned in other posts.

__Marlbots class with No Limits:__ [No Limits for Deaf Children](https://www.nolimitsfordeafchildren.org/) teaches hearing impaired children communication skills and builds self-esteem to help students succeed. Team members have designed and taught a four week series of engineering workshops to give students hands on building experience.

__Marlbots class with Coachart:__ [CoachArt](https://coachart.org/) provides chronically-ill children and families access to arts and athletics programs. Marlborough students hosted a 4-week, twice weekly class in November. Team members created and taught a curriculum that teaches students how to code simple programs and more complicated games in Processing.

__Curiosity class at Mar Vista Family Center__ Team members have been traveling to [Mar Vista Family Center](https://marvistafc.org/) to teach engineering to elementary school students through fun activities like spaghetti towers and lego robots. They hope to inspire their students to see themselves as engineers and scientists who feel empowered to change the world.

__Curiosity class at LA Boys and Girls Club__ Team members have been traveling to [LA Boys and Girls Club](https://www.labgc.org/) to teach engineering to elementary school students through fun activities and prepare them for fielding a lego robotics team next season.

__Asteria at Escuela Plus Elementary__ Asteria has established a relationship with [Escuela Plus elementary](https://www.escuelapluselementary.com/), conducting a robot demo, teaching their design process, and most recently teaching them how to code miniature robots using Scratch. Asteria gave Escuela six mini robot kits for further lessons or exploration.

__Cosmos at the Center for Early Education__ Cosmos visited the [Center for Early Education](https://www.centerforearlyeducation.org/), conducting a robot demo and teaching a lesson on their design process. They also organized a tower building challenge with a fifth grade class to teach about how to learn from failure and iterate their designs. 

__Cosmos at Alexandria House__ Cosmos hosted a bake sale  to raise money for a STEM program at [Alexandria House](https://www.alexandriahouse.org/). With the funds they purchased five Sphero robots and five Fire tablets to program them. They designed a lesson and taught the Alexandria House students how to operate and program the robots. They have since donated the Spheros and tablets to Alexandria house for use in further lessons or exploration.
