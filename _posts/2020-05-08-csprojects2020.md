Our computer science students created some amazing things this year -- please
enjoy these video walkthroughs of their projects!

Student projects are written in the Processing and Java languages, and include
video games, explorations of math, physics and art, a photo booth with image
filters, and data analysis and visualization for Honors Research.

### AP Computer Science _(Dr. Kessner)_

__Space Jam__  
_Ashira '20_  

In this game, you hurtle through space aboard a rocket, avoiding falling
asteroids while attempting to save your astronaut friends along the way.  You
can only gain points by saving as many marooned astronauts as possible, but
don't get hit!  Death and destruction are all around!

__Musical Arrow Game__  
_Leela '23_  

This program allows you to listen to and switch songs randomly. Using beat
detection from the song that is playing, an arrow game will be generated with a
scoring system based on how close you are to the target.

__Bouncing Ball Video Game__  
_Leah '22_  

The point of the game is to collide with as many balls as possible to win. You
use your left and right arrow keys to move the bar.

__Computer Hockey__  
_Grace '20_  
<!--https://youtu.be/fOzYsrFGhog-->

This is a two player game that is similar to air hockey. You gain points by
scoring in your opponent's goal.

__Flee the monster!__  
_Katie '23_  

In this game, the goal is to avoid the monster for as long as possible. You
pick up swords to fight the monster off, and you pick up waters to avoid
becoming dehydrated. Your score is determined by how long you stay alive and
how many stars you pick up.

__Car Race__  
_Max '23_  

<!--https://youtu.be/fRKZBKDziXA-->

In this game, two players must compete to earn the most coins while both
lasting long enough to attempt at claiming the high score. Players must use
speed zones and mud piles to their advantage and their opponent's disadvantage,
all while avoiding getting hit by fireballs.

__Chesn.io__  
_Chesney '23_  
<!--https://youtu.be/yv_KOz00Qu0-->

A fun game where you try to increase your size by absorbing balls smaller than
you, yet still trying not to be absorbed yourself. As the levels pass, the game
gets harder; more elements are added, keeping the player involved and having
fun.
