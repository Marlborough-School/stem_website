The Robotics Program's outreach efforts are in full swing with a number of
recent events. The goal of robotics outreach is twofold; inspire others'
interest in STEM and have our students learn from professionals in STEM fields.
Here are some recent highlights not mentioned in other posts.

__Marlbots class with No Limits:__ [No Limits for Deaf Children](https://www.nolimitsfordeafchildren.org/) teaches hearing impaired children communication skills and builds self-esteem to help students succeed. Team members have designed and taught a four week series of engineering workshops to give students hands on building experience.

__Marlbots class with Coachart:__ [CoachArt](https://coachart.org/) provides chronically-ill children and families access to arts and athletics programs. Marlborough students hosted a 4-week, twice weekly class in November. Team members created and taught a curriculum that teaches students how to code simple programs and more complicated games in Processing.

__Curiosity Maker Talk at Octavia Lab:__ Curiosity partnered with the Octavia Lab at the Los Angeles Public Library to give a one hour "Maker Talk" on the Engineering Design Process, Fabrication Tools, and Coding. It was a great opportunity for Curiosity to share their love for robotics and the FIRST Tech Challenge. You can check out the talk on the LA Library's Youtube Channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54apG-S0kzU)

__Curiosity class at Mar Vista Family Center__ Team members have been traveling to [Mar Vista Family Center](https://marvistafc.org/) to teach engineering to elementary school students through fun activities like spaghetti towers and lego robots. They hope to inspire their students to see themselves as engineers and scientists who feel empowered to change the world.

__Curiosity Fundraisers for the Trevor Project and Kitten Rescue__ [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) is the world's largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ students. [Kitten Rescue](https://kittenrescue.org/) is a non-profit, volunteer-run organization devoted to finding loving new homes for unwanted, homeless cats and kittens.
