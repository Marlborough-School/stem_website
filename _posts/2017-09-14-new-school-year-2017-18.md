introduction: Some thoughts for the 2017-18 school year.

It's a new school year, and I'm excited about all the STEM activities we have
planned for the year!

Here are two thoughts for the school year, the first linking social connections
and belief in yourself to curiosity, and the second linking curiosity to deep
understanding.

> We do not believe in ourselves until someone reveals that deep inside us
> something is valuable, worth listening to, worthy of our trust, sacred to our
> touch. Once we believe in ourselves we can risk curiosity, wonder,
> spontaneous delight or any experience that reveals the human spirit.  
> _e e cummings_

> Toys are not really as innocent as they look. Toys and games are preludes to
> serious ideas.  
> _Charles Eames_
