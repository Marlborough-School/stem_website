For a new project, Mr. Witman and Mrs. Robinson teamed up to help computer programming students re-envision the work of abstract artists.

Mrs. Robinson provided context for the abstract art represented and a selection of artists for students to choose from. She gave the coding students some insight into the process these artists used to create their work, so they could think about how to recreate that process with code.

Students had flexibility in how they carried out their project. They could create a static work inspired by their chosen artist or build an algorithm that would procedurally generate images in their style.  

Check out a side by side selection of the student work below!
