ON Saturday February 23, our MathCounts team competed all day at their chapter
competition at Northrup Grumman in North Redondo:

* Owen ‘23 (captain)
* Chesney ‘23
* Kate ‘23
* Wyeth ‘24

They won first in their division as a team!! Additionally, Owen placed second
overall as an individual, and will be advancing to State next month!!

They all seemed to have a great time!
