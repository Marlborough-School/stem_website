Over the course of the year, the Marlborough Rocketry Club distributed model rocket kits and built them in hybrid club sessions. On Sunday 5/23, Nina '22, Julianne '22, and Chase '23 trekked to the El Mirage Dry Lake Bed to test their creations. El Mirage is a unique expanse of flat ground far from other people and activities; perfect for testing and recovering model rockets in a safe environment.

Throughout the morning many rockets were launched and safely recovered, including a three stage rocket built by Nina '22 and a simultaneous launch of rockets built by Julianne '22' and Chase '23. The experience served as a great model for future visits and club activities in the '21-'22 school year.
