On Wednesday, April 25th, eleven Marlborough students attended Netflix's Women in Tech event. The group heard from female employees that are using innovative technology to streamline localization, deliver cutting edge image quality, and analyze big data to assess content. The students also got a chance to participate in a problem solving session and lots of small group question and answer time with Netflix employees. Our group was hosted by a Marlborough alumna and current Netflix employee, Kathryn Lynyak '11.
