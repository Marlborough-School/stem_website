The new CEI Fabricators student group ran their first workshop in the run up to Winter Break. Participants used a template in the design software [Cuttle](https://cuttle.xyz/) to create a personalized snowflake. The Fabricators then assisted in the cutting and engraving of the design using the Glowforge. The CEI Fabricators were created to serve as liaison between digital fabrication tools and the Marlborough community. Stay tuned for more workshops in the second semester!
