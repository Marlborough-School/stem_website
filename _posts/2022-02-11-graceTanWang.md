Team Curiosity invited Principal Systems Engineer Grace Tan Wang to virtually visit with Marlborough's robotics teams. Grace spent the first half of her 30+ year career in flight systems and the second half in operations. She has worked primarily on JPL flight projects such as Cassini, Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity, and now Perseverance as Deputy Chief Engineer for Surface Development. She also has been working on technology advancements such as the Low Density Supersonic Decelerator project and now is co-leading the Europa Landerâ€™s Autonomy task. Grace has an SB in Aero/Astro from MIT and an MS in Aerospace Engineering from USC.

Grace provided wonderful insight into her career at JPL and her experiences in engineering, the design process of a project at JPL from a systems engineering perspective, and some of her favorite projects that she has worked on such as the Spirit and Opportunity Rovers. Grace emphasized the importance of testing throughout the design process, which we hope to implement more extensively in the future.

From Team Curiosity and the Marlborough community, thank you to Grace for taking the time to share his expertise with us!
