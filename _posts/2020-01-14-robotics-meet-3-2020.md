It is an exciting time in robotics, with all four teams busy preparing for
tournaments on consecutive weekends. 

On Saturday January 18th, Marlborough will host the final League Meet in the
CEI from 8:00 am - 12:00 pm. In this meet teams will each play five qualifying
rounds to accumulate points to carry with them to the elimination tournaments.
The event is open to the public and all are welcome to attend! The best time to
observe matches is between 9:00 and 11:00 am. 

On Sunday January 26th, we will travel to Palmdale Aerospace Academy for an all
day InterLeague tournament. In this event, teams will compete for judged
awards, participate in qualifying matches, and eventually compete in an
elimination bracket to try to earn advancement to the Regional Championship.

rounds. Heading into Meet 3, their league rankings are as follows:
