Students in Dr. Dan Lynch's History class created web-based visual novels for
their final projects. Each student converted their research and writing about
the experiences of a person involved in World War I or World War II into a
compelling visual narrative presentation.

This project was led by student Senya '23, who researched web
programming and visual novels in Honors Computer Science Projects
(taught by Dr. Darren Kessner).
