On Wednesday May 2, we hosted our second SPARC Celebration of Innovation!

The annual event showcases the talent, creativity, and passion of the
collaborators, artists, entrepreneurs, roboticists, programmers, activists, and
designers among us - young problem seekers and solvers who are breaking molds
and shattering stereotypes while leaving a positive and lasting impact on the
world around them.
