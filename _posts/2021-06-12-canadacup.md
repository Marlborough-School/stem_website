Between June 2nd and June 12th, our robotics team Curiosity represented Marlborough in the "Canada Cup," an invitational tournament that included 24 top teams from around the world. The students of Curiosity led the Marlborough effort as they participated in virtual judging sessions, remote pit interviews, and remote matches that were filmed and submitted electronically.  We are excited to announce that Curiosity won the top judged award, the "Inspire Award!" The judges were particularly impressed with Curiosity's engineering portfolio, their modular design, and their outreach to alums in STEM.

You can check out the full awards ceremony below. It is a long video, so here is where Curiosity is most prominently featured;
