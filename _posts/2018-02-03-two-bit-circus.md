On Saturday Marlborough's robotics team Curiosity visited the materials warehouse of the Two Bit Circus Foundation, formerly known as "Trash for teachers".

Two Bit Circus Foundation is a nonprofit educational organization "designed to cultivate the next generation of inventors." This year, Two Bit Circus sponsored Team Curiosity with $500 as well as access to materials from their warehouse.

The team also got to try two interactive gaming machines which showcased creative and highly entertaining methods of social play. Team members expressed interest in recreating a similar experience at Marlborough.
