**Tournament Update**
This Saturday, the top 48 robotics teams from our region traveled to Monrovia High School to compete in a Regional Championship tournament. It was an incredible and inspiring day that saw our students overcome major technical difficulties, unify as a school, advocate for themselves, and perform exceptionally well under immense pressure. We are very proud to report that the Marlbots and Curiosity (with Team Torch of The Centers of Learning in North Hills) allied to become the WINNING ALLIANCE and win the robot game portion of the tournament. In addition, The Marlbots repeated for the second straight year as INSPIRE AWARD winners, the highest and most coveted of judged awards. Below is a summary of their accolades;
