Former Marlborough student Melissa Makous visited Ms. Mino's AP Environmental
Science class.  Melissa gave a presentation on regenerative agriculture, which
describes farming and grazing practices that, among other benefits, reverse
climate change by rebuilding soil organic matter and restoring degraded soil
biodiversity â€“ resulting in both carbon drawdown and improving the water cycle. 

Melissa is a former Marlborough student (2005-2009), who attended Tulane
University and then transferred to UC Berkeley where she studied Society and
Environment, focusing on Agroecology and Food Systems. She is currently the
Livestock and Ag. Assistant Manager at The High Lonesome Ranch in Colorado and
her partner Dakota Glueck is the manager!
