Emma '21 from the Student STEM Committee organized a fun and informative field
trip to Google's campus in Venice.  Students had the opportunity to tour the
campus and hear about what it's like to work at Google.  Students also had a
Q&A session with a panel of engineers, including two women engineers from the
Google Photos team.
