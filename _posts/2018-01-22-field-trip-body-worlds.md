Arabella '19 from the Student STEM Committee organized a fun Sunday afternoon
field trip to the California Science Center to see the Body Worlds exhibit, as
well as the Space Shuttle Endeavor.

[Body Worlds](https://bodyworlds.com) features real human bodies that have been
preserved through a process called plastination.  The exhibit allows visitors
to see anatomical and physiological systems much more clearly than is possible
in a textbook or model.
