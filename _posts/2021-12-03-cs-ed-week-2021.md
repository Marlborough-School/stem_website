__Computer Science Education Week__  
__Dec 6 - 10, 2021__  

Hello Marlborough community!

We have some fun events planned for Computer Science Education Week!  This year
we are exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence, and its effects on
society.

__Pushing Perspectives:  What is AI and Why Should I Care?__  
_Monday Dec 6, Flex, CEI_

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is all around us, for example: recommendation
systems on Netflix, targeted ads on YouTube, credit card fraud detection,
facial recognition systems for tagging photos.  

But what exactly is AI?  Can we use AI to solve all the world's problems?  Or
will we be destroyed by AI-controlled killer robots?  

Dr. Kessner will give us a short introduction to AI, including its potential
benefits, limitations, and dangers to society.

Ready to jump in and see how AI works firsthand?  Code Violet, the Marlborough
coding club, will lead students on a fun coding activity that uses AI to
recognize images from your own webcam!  __No coding experience necessary.__   Bring
your laptop!
