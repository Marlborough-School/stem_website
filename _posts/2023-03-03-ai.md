On Friday March 3rd, a cohort of students led by Director of Studies Jonathon Allen headed to the California Club to hear from a panel of AI experts. The panel was assembled by the Los Angeles World Affairs Council specifically for High Schoolers. The Marlborough students were treated to an impressive lunch, stimulating conversation, and insight into the impact of AI on a broad variety of fields. A favorite quote from the panel (spoken by Todd Terrazas of AI LA); "AI won't take your job, people who know how to use AI will take your job."
