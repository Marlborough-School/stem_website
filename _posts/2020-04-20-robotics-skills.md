With the remainder of the competition season suspended due to COVID-19,
Marlborough Robotics students are finding other ways to put their skills to
good use.

Team members from Curiosity 11770 are coordinating to make protective gear for
healthcare workers. Julianne Hannon '22 took home the school's 3D printer to
create face shields while other members worked on sewing masks. So far twenty
face shields have been distributed to workers in New York, Miami, and Los
Angeles. Check out their [instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-fmSxthh81/).

The Marlbots, Curiosity, and Cosmos are also joining a design competition
sponsored by FIRST and OnShape called [_Robots to the
Rescue_](https://www.onshape.com/robots-to-the-rescue). In this competition
teams will identify a real world problem, design a robot solution, and create a
realistic 3D model using computer aided design (CAD). The teams will be
collaborating virtually in their elective classes while practicing their design
process and CAD skills.
