_Updated Feb 10, 2018_

The Marlborough Student STEM Committee hosted a series of web development
workshops on three Saturdays (Jan 27, Feb 3, Feb 10).  The workshops were led
by an amazing group of UCLA computer science students.

A huge group of highly motivated girls (grades 6-12) attended the workshops,
including students from [Marlborough](http://marlborough.org),
[GALA](https://www.galacademy.org), and several other local schools.

Students learned about making web pages with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  They
also heard firsthand accounts of  what it is like to study computer science in
college and beyond.  A representative from [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com)
visited and gave a presentation on the organization's offerings for Summer 2018.
