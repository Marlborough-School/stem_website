One of Marlborough's robotics teams, Curiosity, was invited to attend the
Society of Women Engineers' Invent It. Build it. Expo in Anaheim on November 9.
Curiosity presented their design process and robot to others. For instance,
they showed how they used CAD to fabricate the parts on their robot. By
participating in the Expo, Curiosity hoped to inspire other young girls to
pursue their passion for STEM and robotics.

Curiosity members also had the chance to explore the variety of opportunities
that engineering offers. SWE members gave advice from their experience in all
types of fields, like civil engineering and environmental engineering to name a
few. There were also tech companies like BP and ABB who presented their work.

Marlborough SWE's club leaders, Grace '20 and Emmi '20 also attended.
They learned about the opportunities and competitions that other SWE Next
Clubs, like Team Spyder, participate in. They hope to organize similar
activities for the SWE chapter at Marlborough in the future.
