introduction:  Marlborough robotics teams hard work this semester is paying off!

The Marlborough robotics teams (Marlbots, Curiosity, Cosmos, Asteria) have a
lot to be proud of this season!

* After two meets, ALL FOUR Marlborough teams are ranked in the top half of our
  League of 14.

* All four teams have a chance of bringing 20 ranking points to the ILT. 20 is
  the maximum number of points you can take, because they drop your 5 lowest
  matches on the way to ILT. Just being in that position is a big
  accomplishment. 

* For the leagues reporting their data, the Marlbots, Cosmos, Curiosity, and
  Asteria are consecutively ranked 6th, 7th, and 8th, and 36th for "Offensive
  Power Ranking" in the state of California.

* All four teams are visible in

Congratulations to all of the robotics students, and thank you to our amazing
coaches Mr. Andy Witman and Dr. Lee Hamill!
