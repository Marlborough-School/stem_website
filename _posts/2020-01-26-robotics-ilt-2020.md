The four Marlborough robotics teams competed in an elimination tournament
on Sunday, January 26 at Palmdale Aerospace Academy. 

This tournament will go down as one of the proudest moments for Marlborough
Robotics. In a moving act of unity, our teams allied in the elimination rounds
and won the robot portion of the game outright. The teams also collected 5 of
the 9 judged awards. By winning the robot game portion of the tournament,
Marlbots, Curiosity, and Asteria will advance to the Los Angeles Regional
