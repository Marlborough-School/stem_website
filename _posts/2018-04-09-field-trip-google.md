37 students (plus Mr. Witman, Dr. Hamill, and Dr. Kessner) went on a field trip
to Google in Venice, CA.

We were given a great tour of the facility, which included a variety of indoor
and outdoor informal working areas, large meeting and presentation spaces,
bikes and surfboards for employees to borrow, and food available in just about
every hallway.
