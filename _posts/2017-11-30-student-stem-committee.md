## Student STEM Committee

The STEM Committee is a new committee as of the 2017/2018 school year and is
led by Dr. Kessner, Mr. Witman, and Sarah Lohmar '18.  Our mission is to
communicate ideas related to STEM across the entire Marlborough community. All
of our committee members share this mission and all have experience in and a
passion for STEM. Due to our more specific goals, we have divided into sub
committees including field trips, event planning, communication, and work with
GALA (a local, public girls school with emphasis on STEM). The committee with
be reaching out to students all year long with exciting opportunities to engage
in STEM. We encourage everyone in the Marlborough community to stop by the
SPARC area in the ARC and learn more about STEM!
