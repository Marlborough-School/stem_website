It's a new school year, and we have lots more STEM stuff planned in the new
Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation!

We have record numbers of students signed up for STEM activities on top of
their already rigorous math and science classes: robotics (50+ students on 4
teams, under the guidance of Mr. Witman and Dr. Hamill), coding (26 students in
advanced computer science classes with Dr. Kessner, in addition to the coding
electives), honors research in science (18 students advised by Dr. Ponzio), and
a brand new engineering course taught by Dr.  Hamill (11 students).  

_Attention new Marlborough students: don't be shy, get involved!_

In my experience, the best way to really understand something is to play with
it.  Here is a thought from Mr. Rogers on cultivating this playful attitude.

> failures, and whether we can find the inner fulfillment that makes working,
> in and of itself, worthwhile.
