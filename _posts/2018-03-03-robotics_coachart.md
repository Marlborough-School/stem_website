On Saturday March 3rd The Marlbots teamed up with CoachArt to share their knowledge of coding with students facing chronic illness. This was the first session of a four week class that includes 17 CoachArt students ranging in age from 5-17. The students are using the computer language Processing to draw and animate with code. The first session was very successful, with lessons on coordinate systems, drawing basic shapes, and changing color and background.
