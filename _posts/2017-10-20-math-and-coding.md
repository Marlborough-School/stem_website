Math and coding -- two great things that go great together!

PreCalculus Honors Accelerated (PCHA) students 
[spent a week in the SPARC](https://photos.app.goo.gl/rdfYXqxcdPH4kObM2)
to learn the basics of coding in Python, as well as to see how to use
parametric equations in computer graphics.

[And here are their completed projects -- awesome job, everyone!](https://photos.app.goo.gl/psANKv3lG9iStQs53)
