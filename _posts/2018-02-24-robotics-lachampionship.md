On Saturday February 24 two of the Marlbotics Robotics teams (Marlbots 3526,
Curiosity 11770) competed at the [FTC LA/SoCal Regional
Championship](http://www.firsttechsocal.org/) in Monrovia.

__The Marlbots advanced to the [2018 FTC West Super Regional
Championship](http://gettravel.com/ftc-west-super-regional-championship/) in
Spokane, Washington!__

It was a long and exciting day, with both teams performing well in the robot
game and working together to solve problems. Team Curiosity got off to a strong
start in qualifying rounds but suffered from disconnection problems in the
later rounds. Despite this they finished with the 12th best Offensive Power
Ranking in their division and came away with a lot of knowledge they can apply
to next year. Also, student Kyra '19 was one of only THREE students that
qualified as a finalist for the "Dean's List Award." This award recognizes the
leadership and dedication of the most outstanding robotics students and gives
Kyra an invitation to the World Championship in Houston. 

The Marlbots qualified fourth in their division and ended up as the captain of
a very strong third seeded alliance. It was The Marlbots' match to win or lose
against the second seeded alliance. They pushed their semifinal elimination
matchup to three rounds but a misaligned claw mechanism cost them the final
round and they were eliminated from the robot game. However, the Marlbots won
the Design Award for their unique "Ferris Wheel" Claw mechanism and the design
process they used to create it. In addition, they won the 2nd Place Inspire
award for overall team performance.
