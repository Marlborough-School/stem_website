We are wrapping up the third year of our Engineering Design & Analysis course
offered at Marlborough. Though distance learning presented its challenges, it
also reminded us just how important it is to incorporate remote collaboration
practices into our curriculum. Students continued to engage in meaningful
engineering experiences, including plenty of physical building opportunities
and practicing good documentation habits in their engineering notebook. In
addition, students digitally shared documentation of their daily activities and
progress through weekly reports 
([Example 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ggRswQO7UhR7B_a3eP859Ol1Wkb2YUdVQUVVtMq2ngA/edit?usp=sharing), 
[Example 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dB1zm_gR6ICOjL9vpieKbP4MDCoKw-bOc6iwFrVddeA/edit?usp=sharing)) 
and became proficient in computer aided design. Below is an overview of the
projects students engaged in this year and links to examples of student work.


__Project 1: Camera Obscura__

_Purpose:_ Students get their first experience going through the engineering
design process and fabricating their design.

_Design Challenge:_ Design and build a wearable camera obscura with multiple
aperture options that can be operated by a single person and accommodates
people with limited dexterity. The user must also be able to control the size
of the image while wearing.

_Deliverables:_ User Instructions 
([Example 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16P1Wc3PzSbZe2P2lw-3pWVje_z6H3DwbqbkWKOsXSa0/edit?usp=sharing),
[Example 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iRwEz7tfslzFZ7W1QYwGi8XUs7FUDyfquKtCWHuk7-I/edit?usp=sharing)) 
and Manufacturing
Instructions 
([Example 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BDE3Ps1PvdMM_1cZOw9TmoVrBMF0_6IkkjgDaClKsFI/edit?usp=sharing), 
[Example 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EWG5ihsxWRcMDPSGQ83Xjq08DMfPe-2Y0n2-yWmU4cs/edit?usp=sharing))

__Project 2: Solve a Peerâ€™s Design Challenge__

_Purpose:_ Students learn how to actively include their user in the design
process and how to do computer aided design.

_Design Challenge:_ Solve a challenge presented to you by a partner. 
[Examples of design challenges](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-gaefGYdKWLYtedt_GVJ_-10UWrTRLlXFn9ig4wQOx0/edit?usp=sharing)
developed by students that they presented to their partner.

_Deliverable:_ Technical Memo 
([Example 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TGGaNGueBpvAqnTC4ftNqzTRhB3vs-Xf44RjIvw0kYs/edit?usp=sharing), 
[Example 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q4tLKK5PDdyZ6Zxpyb52uzevOnI67AjPypkENnH4YDQ/edit?usp=sharing))


__Project 3: Safer Buildings__

_Purpose:_ Students learn how to collect quantitative data and use it to drive
and justify design decisions.

_Design Challenge:_ Redesign an apartment building in Olympia, WA -- which is in
an earthquake-prone region of the state.

_Deliverable:_ Statement of Qualifications 
([Example 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/108qzcfLoHhunSHizDeaOku-s0ksPMM5uo6jWIUzeesE/edit?usp=sharing), 
[Example 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1heELO04Z2If0SIH7RAJCF-jw65q1D3znGSKG5fwK75M/edit?usp=sharing))
