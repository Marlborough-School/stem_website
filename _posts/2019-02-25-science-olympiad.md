With exceptional leadership from Francoise Martinetti and Emma Cruz, the
Marlborough Science Olympiad Team competed in Regional Finals this weekend at
Rio Hondo College in Whittier. Each duo/trio listed below self-identified areas
to compete in which didnâ€™t necessarily align with courses they have taken or
any prior experience. Some chose to step outside of their comfort zone to
challenge themselves, or to simply try something fun. 

Working together to prepare for these testing and build events was a great
experience for them.  _(Khanichi Charles, Science instructor)_
