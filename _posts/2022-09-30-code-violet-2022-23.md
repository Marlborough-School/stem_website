The student leaders of Code Violet, Marborough's coding club, held
their first meeting in the SPARC, and jumped right into coding!

Marlborough students use code to tell stories, write video games,
create visual art, analyze data, or control robots!  If you want to
learn to code, join Code Violet, or talk to Dr. Kessner about our
coding classes!
