The Marlbots competed in the FTC LA Regional Championship this Saturday, 3/9 at
Monrovia High School. This tournament brought together the top 48 teams from
the greater LA region for a chance to qualify for the World Championship in
Houston. The event was extremely competitive with only 7 of the 48 teams
advancing.

Tournament summary from Mr. Witman, coach of the Marlbots:

The Marlbots opened with a very strong robot performance in the first round of
the day, and were consistently among the highest point scorers in every round.
They had some tough matchups in qualifying rounds, and due to circumstances
beyond their control they ended with a 3/5 record in qualifying rounds and
seeded 8th of 24. They were the first pick of the second seed during alliance
selection. The Marlbots tried to carry their alliance out of the semi-finals,
but were eventually eliminated by the 3rd seeded alliance in the third round of
a best of three series.

At this point, the large Marlborough contingent in the audience was feeling
disappointed but extremely proud of the students and their impressive
performance. There was a sense that the Marlbots had one of the best robots and
by circumstance narrowly missed winning the robot portion of the tournament
outright. So of course, when the Inspire Award was finally announced at the end
of a long awards ceremony, there was a large outpouring of emotion.
