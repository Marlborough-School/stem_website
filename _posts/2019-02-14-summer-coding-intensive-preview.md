__2019 Summer Coding Intensive (for girls)__  
Instructor: Dr. Kessner  
Session Dates: June 10-14  
9:00am – 12:30pm  
Grades 7-12  

This one week intensive coding workshop will introduce students to computer
graphics programming using the Processing language. Students will learn how to
create their own interactive animations and video games that run as desktop
applications, in web pages, or on mobile devices. The workshop will introduce
students to standard programming concepts such as variables, functions,
conditionals, and loops. Students who are interested in taking AP Computer
Science A (Java) in the Fall may take this workshop as a “crash course” in
coding, and they will be given supplementary exercises.
