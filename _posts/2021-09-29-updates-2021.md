## Engineering

We are excited to announce that Marlborough will be participating in the
national competition, Project Invent, this year! Project Invent is a year-long
program in which teams of students collaborate with a community partner and
design a product that will help their community partner in some way. Each team
will go through the entire engineering design process, all the way from
needfinding to actually building their final design. During the initial stages,
teams will interview and collaborate with their community partner to identify a
need on which to focus. They will then spend the rest of the year
brainstorming, prototyping, testing and revising their design. The only
requirement from the program is that the design is a physical product with a
technological component. The rest is up to the students! In April, students
will travel to San Diego to present their product to a panel of industry
professionals. The winner of the event will be invited to a national showcase
in San Jose in May. More information about Project Invent can be found on their
[website](https://projectinvent.org/), along with 
[examples of previous projects](https://projectinvent.org/projects).


## Robotics

The FIRST Tech Challenge season officially kicked off on September 18th with
the reveal of the new game "Freight Frenzy." Our four teams are diving into
their design process by analyzing the game, building prototypes, and testing
their creations. The teams are also looking forward to competing in-person at
the first Meet on November 13th, hosted at Marlborough in the CEI.

### SPARC Equipment Update

The SPARC workshop underwent an equipment upgrade over the summer to enhance
students' ability to fabricate custom parts. In addition to a new 3D printer
and laser cutter, the space now also boasts a brand new Shopbot Desktop CNC
machine. The Shopbot will enable students to precisely cut and engrave a
variety of materials including polycarbonate and aluminum. Other upgrades
include the installation of a fume hood and fume extractors so a wider variety
of materials can be safely cut and printed indoors.

## Computer Science

We are bringing more web development into the curriculum, with Honors Computer
Science students exploring web-based visual novels
([example](https://dkessner.github.io/alice/)).  Later this school year they
will be leading a collaboration with History students on research projects
presented as visual novels.

Other students in Honors Computer Science Projects are looking forward to the
All-School Dance Concert this semester.  They are currently working with
student (and teacher) choreographers to create video projections for the
concert [[2019 concert](http://stem.marlborough.org/blog/asdc-2019/)].
We are also looking forward to continuing our collaboration with our 
Social Justice and Community Partnerships program this year.

We have fully embraced 
[Open Educational Resources](https://dkessner.github.io/TeacherResources)
in the Computer Science curriculum.  We use open textbooks and other open
educational resources in all of our coding classes.  We are also exploring
methods for sharing our own educational resources, both with our students
and beyond our walls.
