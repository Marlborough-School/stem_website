## Kickoff in Monrovia
This Saturday representatives from all FOUR Marlborough Robotics teams headed to Monrovia High School to witness the 'launch' of this season's new game; **Rover Ruckus**. The auditorium at Monrovia was packed as hundreds of robotics students from around Southern California eagerly awaited the national release of the game video. The space themed game features robots departing their 'lander,' planting a marker to claim a 'depot', and collecting gold and silver 'minerals'.

Marlborough students saw the new playing field first hand, then participated in a series of workshops about different aspects of the FIRST Tech Challenge. These ranged from advanced coding techniques to tips for awards and judging.

This week students in the robotics classes will start analyzing the game and developing their robot concepts. They will need to move quickly to prepare for the first League meet on November 3rd. Check out the full season schedule below!
