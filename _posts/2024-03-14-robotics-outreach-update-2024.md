The Robotics Program's outreach efforts are in full swing with a number of
recent events. The goal of robotics outreach is twofold; inspire others'
interest in STEM and have our students learn from professionals in STEM fields.
Here are some recent highlights not mentioned in other posts.

__Asteria at Angeles House:__ Asteria has established a relationship with Union Rescue Mission's [Angeles House](https://urm.org/services/urms-angeles-house/), which provides housing for unsheltered children and their parents. Asteria raised money through a bake sale to purchase a set of six Edison robots and tablets, which they have used to conduct several in-person programming lessons for Angeles House students.

__Stratus at Elementary Schools:__ Team Stratus has undertaken a series of robot demos for local elementary school students. Stops included [Westland School](https://www.westlandschool.org/), [Wonderland School](https://wonderlandschool.org/), and [Laurence School](https://www.laurenceschool.com/). In each case, Stratus met with classes to share about their experience in the FIRST Tech Challenge, showcase their robot, and give students an opportunity to drive demo bots.

__Marlbots classes with No Limits:__ [No Limits for Deaf Children](https://www.nolimitsfordeafchildren.org/) teaches hearing impaired children communication skills and builds self-esteem to help students succeed. Team members continued their annual four week series of engineering workshops to give students hands on building experience.

__Marlbots classes with Coachart:__ [CoachArt](https://coachart.org/) provides chronically-ill children and families access to arts and athletics programs. Marlborough students continue to annually host a 4-week, twice weekly class. Team members created and taught a curriculum that teaches students how to code simple programs and more complicated games in Processing.

__Curiosity class at Mar Vista Family Center:__ Team members continue to travel to [Mar Vista Family Center](https://marvistafc.org/) to teach engineering to elementary school students through fun activities like spaghetti towers and lego robots. They hope to inspire their students to see themselves as engineers and scientists who feel empowered to change the world.

__Curiosity Lego Robotics at LA Boys and Girls Club__ After raising over $1000 at bake sales, Curiosity purchased materials and registration for a Lego Robotics Team at the [LA Boys and Girls Club](https://www.labgc.org/).  They hope to successfully field a team at competition next season.
