The Robotics Program's outreach efforts are in full swing with a number of
recent events. The goal of robotics outreach is twofold; inspire others'
interest in STEM and have our students learn from professionals in STEM fields.
Here are some recent highlights from the past few weeks.

__Curiosity visits Quibi:__  Students were hosted by the head of product at
Quibi, the upcoming short-form mobile streaming entertainment company. Here
they learned about parallels between their team and real world careers, as well
as advice for being a woman in tech fields.

__STEM All School Meeting at Marlborough:__  The teams gave an overview of the
program, including a full scale demonstration of a robotics match with all four
teams.

__STEAM Festival at the Center for Early Education:__ The Marlbots and Curiosity
showed off their design process and demoed their robots at an evening event for
students at the Center.

__Cosmos visits Larchmont Charter School:__ Team members gave a presentation to
the middle school about their design process, the FIRST Tech Challenge, and the
value of iterative design and learning from your mistakes.

__Curiosity visits Headspace:__ Students were hosted by software engineers at
Headspace, the popular meditation and mindfulness app. Team members got a
chance to share their story and get feedback on their designs and process.

__The Marlbots visit No Limits:__ Team members introduced robotics to a group of
students at No Limits, an organization that provides meaningful after school
experiences to students with hearing impairments. This outreach was a preview
for a robotics and coding class the Marlbots will be teaching at No Limits in
March.
