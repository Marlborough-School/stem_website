On Saturday February 17 the three Marlborough robotics teams (Marlbots,
Curiosity, Cosmos) were among 29 teams competing in an InterLeague tournament
at Palmdale Aerospace Academy.  All three performed extremely well and were
ranked in the top 8 of 29 after qualifying rounds _(

)_.

The tournament came to an absolutely thrilling finish, with a final that
featured a head to head face off between our teams Marlbots and Curiosity!  In
the end, Curiosity's alliance came out on top and won the highest robot
performance award. The Marlbots were in the runner up alliance and won the
highest judged award. Both teams will advance to the [FTC LA/SoCal Regional
Championship](http://www.firsttechsocal.org/) at Monrovia High School on
February 24th. The best part was seeing the goodwill and support our teams
showed to one another despite being on opposite sides of the field!
