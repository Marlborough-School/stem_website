The AP Spanish classes recently finished a series of presentations on recent
advancements in science and technology in both the US and different
Spanish-speaking countries. Students were asked to discover articles written in
Spanish about their chosen topics, which ranged from plastic surgery to gene
editing to global warming. They then compared how the US was addressing the
topic to how Spain and other countries in Latin America were addressing it.
Once they had their information, students created a presentation to give to the
class, as practice for oral presentations on the actual AP exam.

"La ciencia y tecnologia" is one of the five possible topics on the AP exam.
All the parts of the exam will fall into one of these five topics, so students
spend some time focusing on each one. Because the goal of these exams is to
increase proficiency in the language, the topics focus on important subjects
that are crucial to conversation, from contemporary life and communities to
global challenges.  Because science and technology are becoming so influential
in today's world, it's no wonder that it's part of the exam trying to help
people to work and exist in today's world, even if all these vocabulary words
can sometimes get a little jumbled- was it _computadora_ or _programa_?
