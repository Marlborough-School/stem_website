After months of online collaboration, the robotics teams were back on campus in small groups this past week. They worked in a physically distanced environment to ready their robots for remote competition.

For remote events, the teams have a one week window of time to play, score, and submit their matches.  For the first time this season, the Marlbots were able to run and submit all six of their matches. This milestone was a great opportunity to test the robot and make plans for future adjustments.

All four teams are nearing completion of their robots. The students are looking forward to competing in another remote scrimmage from March 1st-7th. This will be a final chance to test the robots before Qualifying Tournaments begin in late March.
