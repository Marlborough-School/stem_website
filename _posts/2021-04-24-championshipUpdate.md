This Saturday 4/24 the Marlbots and Curiosity competed remotely against 34 top teams at the SoCal FIRST Tech Challenge Regional Championship. With only a couple weeks to prepare, our teams were strategic and each team targeted specific award categories based on their strengths. In a great endorsement of goal planning, their goals aligned perfectly with the outcome. Both Marlbots and Curiosity wowed the judges and collected their targeted awards as well as other accolades. It is worth noting that a team can only win 1st place in one judged award category.

__Marlbots__
* 1st Place Innovate Award for their extremely unique 'ring harvesting' mechanism.
* 2nd Place Inspire Award given to the 2nd best overall team that is strong in both technical and non-technical award categories.
* 2nd Place Design Award for overall robot design and construction.
* 3rd Place Think Award for an outstanding Engineering Portfolio that clearly articulated their team's journey and robot design.
* 2nd Place Promote Award for a compelling PSA style video that promotes the FIRST Tech Challenge.

__Curiosity__
* 1st Place Think Award for an outstanding Engineering Portfolio that clearly articulated their team's journey and robot design.
* 3rd Place Connect Award for connecting and learning with members of the engineering and alumnae community
* 12th Place for Robot Performance in the Robot Game, a notable achievement given the reduced time we had during the pandemic

This marks the first time two Marlborough teams have won 1st place in judged awards at the Regional Championship level. In a normal year, both teams would likely advance to the World Championship. However, with Worlds canceled this will mark the end of our official season.
