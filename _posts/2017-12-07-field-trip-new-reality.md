Dr. Kessner, Mr. Witman, Ms. Wright, and Dr. Sands all joined a group of
computer science students on a field trip to 
[New Reality Co](http://newreality.co/).

New Reality Co. uses cutting edge virtual reality technology to bring awareness
to social justice issues.  We had the opportunity to experience New Reality
Co's award winning VR productions [Giant](http://giantofficial.com/) and
[Tree](https://www.treeofficial.com/).
